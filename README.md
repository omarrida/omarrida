This is my personal site made with Gatsby.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Local Dev

To run on your personal machine, make sure you have NPM and the Gatsby CLI installed. Then run the following commands:

```shell script
npm install
```

```shell script
gatsby develop
```

You should now see the site running at http://localhost:8000/.
